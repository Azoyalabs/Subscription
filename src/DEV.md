Modify subscription option to add active / inactive field?  
Also perform check on currency used in subscription option: currently ignoring it, which is problematic  
maybe also add id to the subscription option, to perform tracking? can enable single time use for subscription option. Is bigger in scope though  

Maybe just perform equality check on input, require coin/pricing to be provided?
